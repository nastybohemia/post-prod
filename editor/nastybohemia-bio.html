    <p><img class="artist-photo" src="/assets/img/NastyBohemia-photo-1.jpg" alt="NastyBohemia-photo" align="left">I'm Sophie Popova. I live my bohemian life in Los Angels and I'm nasty. So, I sign my works with the alias "Nasty Bohemia" to avoid confusion. Mostly I do something on my laptop, but I also make movies, write lyrics (coming soon) and let ppl take pictures of me. Sometimes to do so I travel to New York.<br><br>

All I know I learned in the color correction & video editing classes, reading manuals, attending conferences, in the film school and simply because I was always bored as a kid.<br><br>

Many people think that if they know a shortcut for the razor tool or how to add contrast to the flat image they can call themselves a post-production artist. I value that the project should be properly organized, so, everyone is able to understand what's going on. I'd never name a file "project name_final_final". When it comes to creative part I'm looking for unique creative solutions and not trying to create teal-orange-one-thousand.<br><br>

I do post-production work like video editing, color correction or motion graphics which falls under the categories of movies, music videos, promo content. I carry my MacBook Pro almost everywhere: my apartment, clients office, coffeeshops, salad bars, hotel lobbies, Universal Studios, Warner Brothers.</p>
